        <p>Definition and Usage
            The 'hr' tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page (e.g. a shift of topic). The 'hr' element is most often displayed as a horizontal rule that is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.</p>
        <p> The 'a' HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address. Content within each 'a' should indicate the link's destination.</p>
